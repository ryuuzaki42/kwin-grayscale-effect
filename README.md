# Installation

## KDE 4

1. [Download](https://github.com/murat-cileli/kwin-grayscale-effect/archive/master.zip)

2. Copy "kwin4_effect_grayscale" folder to "/usr/share/apps/kwin/effects/", using:
```{.bash}
cp -r kwin4_effect_grayscale/ /usr/share/apps/kwin/effects/
```
3. Copy "kwin4_effect_grayscale.desktop" to "/usr/share/kde4/services/kwin/", using:
```{.bash}
cp kwin4_effect_grayscale.desktop /usr/share/kde4/services/kwin/
```
4. Add "kwin4_effect_grayscaleEnabled=true" to "[Plugins]" section in "~/.kde/share/config/kwinrc" (as a normal user).

5. Reboot.

6. Open System Settings > Desktop Behavior. In there, open Desktop Effects. You should see Grayscale in the Appearance section. Toggle it a couple of times, and you'll see the grayscale effect at work. Press Alt + shift + F12 to reload effect.

## KDE 5

1. [Download](https://github.com/murat-cileli/kwin-grayscale-effect/archive/master.zip) or Git Pull
2. Copy "kwin4_effect_grayscale" folder to "/usr/share/kwin/effects", using e.g.
```{.bash}
sudo cp -r kwin4_effect_grayscale /usr/share/kwin/effects
```
3. Copy "kwin4_effect_grayscale.desktop" to "/usr/share/kservices5/kwin", using e.g.

sudo cp kwin4_effect_grayscale.desktop /usr/share/kservices5/kwin
```
4. Add "kwin4_effect_grayscaleEnabled=true" to "[Plugins]" section in "~/.config/kwinrc" (as a normal user).
In case the [Plugins] section is missing from the kwinrc file, just add it.

To test it for the first time, open `System Settings` > `Desktop Behavior`. In there, open `Desktop Effects`. You should see `Grayscale` in the `Appearance` section. Toggle it a couple of times, and you'll see the grayscale effect at work.


### Known Quirks

- **Settings doesn't apply**:
  - In System Settings, uncheck "Grayscale" and re-check then apply.
  - Make sure the persmissions in are set to `drwxr-xr-x` for the `kwin4_effect_grayscale` folder and its content. If not, run (as root)
    ```{.bash}
    chmod 755 /usr/share/kwin/effects/kwin4_effect_grayscale/
    find /usr/share/kwin/effects/kwin4_effect_login/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} +.
    ```
